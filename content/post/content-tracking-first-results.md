The work done by HEG Genève for the content tracking, one of the most exploratory tasks of SONAR project, already led to interesting data.

According to both the literature and our preliminary analyses, more than half of Swiss scientific publications belong to the biomedical domain.

### MEDLINE and PubMed Central

Since 1879, the US National Library of Medicine indexes articles published in reference journals dealing with life sciences and medicine, and a bibliographic database has been made publicly available online since 1971: the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, or [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html).

In 2019, MEDLINE has passed the mark of 30 million bibliographic records. In parallel, 2.5 million of these publications are available as Open Access, and stored in [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/), a free full-text archive maintained by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information. These resources are thus a place of choice for recovering a large portion of Swiss publications.

Both MEDLINE and PubMed Central ressources are accessible via the [PubMed interface](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).

### How the data is processed by SONAR

For SONAR, the HEG Genève exploits MEDLINE and PubMed Central for:

1.	Gathering all bibliographic records with a Swiss institution mentioned in the affiliation metadata, thanks to a manually designed authority list of 75 institutions written in 523 ways 
1.	On those, gathering all Open Access full-texts and thus measuring the percentage of Open Access.

The following graph displays the number of records in MEDLINE and the percentage of Open Access, for top publishing Swiss institutions since 2015.
